>JitPack is a novel package repository for JVM and Android projects. It builds Git projects on demand and provides you with ready-to-use artifacts (jar, aar).

## Steps
1. Create an Android project and add a library module, here my library module name is mylibrary.
2. Add the android-maven plugin in your project/build.gradle
3. In your library/build.gradle add maven plugin and group setting
4. Upload this project to your github
5. Create a release tag
6. Open JitPack and lookup your repository
7. Now you can get your library from JitPack!

## Other Git Hosts
JitPack also works with other Git hosting providers. The only difference is the groupId of your artifacts:
- BitBucket: org.bitbucket.Username:Repo:Tag
- GitLab: com.gitlab.Username:Repo:Tag

## Private Repos
Currently seems only github and bitbucket are works.(2017/03/06)
